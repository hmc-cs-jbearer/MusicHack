# MusicHack
Virtual jukebox for the Spring '16 5c Hackathon

Collaborative radio for communal speakers, such as in a dorm courtyard. Users can see information about currently playing music, upvote or downvote the current song, request a song using coins, and earn coins by having their song selections upvoted.

Currently transitioning from a semi-working Hackathon prototype written in Python to a Node.js-based backend, since we can interface with Firebase more easily with Javascript.
